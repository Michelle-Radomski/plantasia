        <h1>Plantasia, keep track of your urban jungle</h1>
        <h2>Overview for your green friends</h2>
        <p>Sometimes we don't see the wood for the trees anymore. We love plants so much that we buy them every chance
            we
            get.
            Before you know it you have your own urban jungle in your living room! It can be quite challenging to take
            care
            of our little babies in that case.
            Luckily Plantasia has you covered! It will help you keep track of your collection of plants. You can easily
            access your overview <a href="myplants">here</a> or via My Plants.
        </p>
        <h2>What else has Plantasia to offer?</h2>
        <p>Not only can you check information about your plants, you can also add, update and even delete (RIP) plants
            in your collection.
            Isn't that neat?!
        </p>
        <h3>Add</h3>
        <p>So, you could not resist and bought a new plant? Time to add it to your collection!
            You can add plants in the My Plants section where you can also find an overview of your plants.
        </p>
        <h3>Update</h3>
        <p>You're not happy with the name you gave your plant, you were so excited that you miss typed some info or
            you found out something interesting about your little buddy? Whatever the reason,
            it's always handy to be able to update information about a specific plant.
            You've probably noticed the big button "Update" when you visit a specific plant in your collection?
            Give it a try!
        </p>
        <h3>Delete</h3>
        <p>Ofourse we do everything we can to make our plants feel at home but sometimes things go wrong and they die.
            Or,
            on a more positive note,
            maybe you decided to give away a plant as a gift! To keep our collection clean and tidy, it's necesarry to
            delete some plants from our collection.
            As for anything else, we got you covered. You can delete any specific plant that's no longer in your
            possession.
            Just like with update you can find a "Delete" button when you visit a specific plant in your collection.
