# Project: Plantasia

## Important note

Ever since we started using laravel for our projects, I had some trouble with my laptop. All of them were fixable except one: npm. For some unknown reason I can use npm install in my terminal but the moment I want to use npm run dev or npm run watch, it doesn't work anymore. Unfortunately I could not use SASS or tailwind for this project. Instead I used vanilla CSS to add some styling. 
## The goal

This project is to test my knowledge of:

- How to setup a basic Laravel application
- How to work with a database
- Have a basic understanding of MVC (model-view-controller) and CRUD (create-read-update-delete)

in order to prepare for building (slightly) bigger things.

## My topic :palm_tree::seedling::sunflower:

The coaches of our class let us choose our own idea for a website with the requirement of a database. 
I chose something with plants cause I was (totally not intentional for this exercise) just making a list of all my plants at home and how to take care of them. 

The idea is to create an environment where people can keep track of their plants. The more plants you have, the more difficult it seems to become to remember which plant needs what exactly. Users would be able to create an account and when they log in, they get to see their collection of plants where they can add new plants and update or delete existing ones.

The idea I had in mind is not fully finished in this project but I may do so in the future.
For now you can add, update and delete plants (CRUD principle) but I haven't implemented a login yet. To still showcase my idea, I filled the database with fake plants and fake users to at least show the goal of this project.
